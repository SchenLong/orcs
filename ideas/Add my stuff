# Feed the ORCS

If you would like to contribute to the ORCS with the ressources you have accumulated over the course of your OSINT experience you are more than welcome to add them below win the form that pleases you most:

ie: Github 

Name: Github
URL: https://github.com
Category: Tools
Sub-category: Collaborative platforms

The ressources/project/tools you will provide will be added to the ORCS until a frontend is build, allowing a more flexible and independent approach to contribute.
